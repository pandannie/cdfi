			<p class="mask"><b>MASK PIECE</b><br>

			<p class="cloud"><b>CLOUD PIECE</b><br> 
				 <br>
				Imagine the clouds dripping.<br>
				Dig a hole in your garden to<br>
				put them in.<br>
				 <br>
				1963 spring</p>

			<p class="air"><b>AIR TALK</b><br>
				 <br>
				It’s sad that the air is the only<br>
				thing we share.<br>
				No matter how close we get to each other,<br>
				there is always air between us.<br>
				 <br>
				It’s also nice that we share the air.<br>
				No matter how far apart we are,<br>
				the air links us.<br>
				 <br>
				from Lisson Gallery brochure ’67</p>

			<p class="floating"> A floating city<br>
				The second level world<br>
				Upstairs on the clouds<br>
				Mountains and rain roaring underneath<br>
				Like venice, we have to commute by <br>
				boat through air currents to visit<br>
				eachothers floating houses.<br>
				Cloud gardens to watch all day.<br>
				 <br>
				From THE SOUNDLESS MUSIC (original text in Japanese) 1950</p>

			<p class="rape"><b>ON RAPE</b><br>
				 <br>
				Violence is a sad wind that, if channeled carefully, could bring seeds, chairs and all things pleasant to us.<br>
				We are all would-be Presidents of the World, and kids kicking the sky that doesn’t listen.<br>
				What would you do if you had only one penis and a one-way tube ticket when you want to fuck the whole nation in one come?<br>
				I know a professor of philosophy whose hobby is to quietly crush biscuit boxes in a supermarket.<br>
				Maybe you can send signed, plastic lighters to people in place of your penis. But then some people might take your lighter as a piece of sculpture and keep it up in their living-room shelf.<br>
				So we go on eating and feeding frustration every day, lick lollipops and stay being peeping-toms dreaming of becoming Jack-the-Ripper. </p>
